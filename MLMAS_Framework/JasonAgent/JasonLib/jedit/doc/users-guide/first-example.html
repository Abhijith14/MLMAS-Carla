   Running this one line script causes jEdit to display a message
   box (more precisely, a <tt class="classname">JOptionPane</tt> object) with
   the traditional beginner's message and an <span><b class="guilabel">OK</b></span> button.
   Let's see what is happening here.
  </p><p>
   This statement calls a static method (or function) named
   <tt class="function">message</tt> in jEdit's <a href="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/Macros.html" target="_top">Macros</a>
   class. If you don't know anything about classes or static methods or
   Java (or C++, which employs the same concept), you will need to gain
   some understanding of a few terms. Obviously this is not the place for
   academic precision, but if you are entirely new to object-oriented
   programming, here are a few skeleton ideas to help you with BeanShell.
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
     An <i class="glossterm">object</i> is a collection of data that can be
     initialized, accessed and manipulated in certain defined ways.
    </p></li><li><p>
     A <i class="glossterm">class</i> is a specification of what data an object
     contains and what methods can be used to work with the data. A Java
     application consists of one or more classes (in the case of jEdit ,over
     600 classes) written by the programmer that defines the application's
     behavior. A BeanShell macro uses these classes, along with built-in
     classes that are supplied with the Java platform, to define its own
     behavior.
    </p></li><li><p>
     A <i class="glossterm">subclass</i> (or child class) is a class which
     uses (or &#8220;<span class="quote">inherits</span>&#8221;) the data and methods of its parent
     class along with additions or modifications that alter the subclass's
     behavior.  Classes are typically organized in hierarchies of parent
     and child classes to organize program code, to define common
     behavior in shared parent class code, and to specify the types of
     similar behavior that child classes will perform in their own specific ways.
    </p></li><li><p>
     A <i class="glossterm">method</i> (or function) is a procedure that works
     with data in a particular object, other data (including other objects)
     supplied as <i class="glossterm">parameters</i>, or both. Methods
     typically are applied to a particular object which is an
     <i class="glossterm">instance</i> of the class to which the method
     belongs.
    </p></li><li><p>
     A <i class="glossterm">static method</i> differs from other methods
     in that it does not deal with the data in a particular object but is
     included within a class for the sake of convenience.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
   Java has a rich set of classes defined as part of the Java platform.
   Like all Java applications, jEdit is organized as a set of classes that
   are themselves derived from the Java platform's classes. We will refer
   to <i class="firstterm">Java classes</i> and <i class="firstterm">jEdit
   classes</i> to make this distinction. Some of jEdit's classes
   (such as those dealing with regular expressions and XML) are derived
   from or make use of classes in other open-source Java packages. Except
   for BeanShell itself, we won't be discussing them in this guide.
  </p><p>
   In our one line script, the static method
   <tt class="function">Macros.message()</tt> has two parameters because that is
   the way the method is defined in the <a href="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/Macros.html" target="_top">Macros</a>
   class. You must specify both parameters when you call the function. The
   first parameter, <i class="parameter"><tt>view</tt></i>, is a variable naming
   the current, active <a href="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/View.html" target="_top">View</a> object. Information
   about pre-defined variables can be found in <a href="predefined-variables.html" title="Predefined Variables in BeanShell">the section called &#8220;Predefined Variables in BeanShell&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
   The second parameter, which appears to be quoted text, is a
   <i class="glossterm">string literal</i> - a sequence of characters of
   fixed length and content. Behind the scenes, BeanShell and Java take
   this string literal and use it to create a <tt class="classname">String</tt>
   object. Normally, if you want to create an object in Java or BeanShell,
   you must construct the object using the <tt class="function">new</tt> keyword
   and a <i class="firstterm">constructor</i> method that is part of the
   object's class. We'll show an example of that later. However, both Java
   and BeanShell let you use a string literal anytime a method's parameter
   calls for a <tt class="classname">String</tt>.
  </p><p>
   If you are a Java programmer, you might wonder about a few things
   missing from this one line program. There is no class definition, for
   example. You can think of a BeanShell script as an implicit definition
   of a <tt class="function">main()</tt> method in an anonymous class. That is
   in fact how BeanShell is implemented; the class is derived from
   a BeanShell class called <a href="../api/bsh/XThis.html" target="_top">XThis</a>. If you
   don't find that helpful, just think of a script as one or more blocks of
   procedural statements conforming to Java syntax rules. You will also get
   along fine (for the most part) with C or C++ syntax if you leave out
   anything to do with pointers or memory management - Java and BeanShell
   do not have pointers and deal with memory management automatically.
  </p><p>
    Another missing item from a Java perspective is a
    <tt class="function">package</tt> statement. In Java, such a statement is
    used to bundle together a number of files so that their classes become
    visible to one another. Packages are not part of BeanShell,
    and you don't need to know anything about them to write
    BeanShell macros.
  </p><p>
    Finally, there are no <tt class="function">import</tt> statements in this
    script. In Java, an <tt class="function">import</tt> statement makes public
    classes from other packages visible within the file in which the
    statement occurs without having to specify a fully
    qualified class name. Without an import statement or a fully qualified
    name, Java cannot identify most classes using a single name as an identifier.
  </p><p>
   jEdit automatically imports a number of commonly-used packages into the
   namespace of every BeanShell script. Because of this, the script output
   of a recorded macro does not contain <tt class="function">import</tt>
   statements. For the same reason, most BeanShell scripts you write will
   not require <tt class="function">import</tt> statements.
  </p><p>
    Java requires <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement to be located
    at the beginning of a source file. BeanShell allows you to place
    <tt class="literal">import</tt>
    statements anywhere in a script, including inside a block of
    statements. The <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement will cover all names
    used following the statement in the enclosing block.
  </p><p>
    If you try to use a class that is not imported without its
    fully-qualified name, the BeanShell interpreter will complain with an
    error message relating to the offending line of code.
