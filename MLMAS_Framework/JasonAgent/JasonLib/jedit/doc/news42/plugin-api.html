		In jEdit 4.1 and earlier, plugins are always fully loaded at program
		startup, and unloaded at program shutdown. While the plugin loader and
		API was very simple as a result, this scheme had two main
		disadvantages:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Having a large number of plugins generally slowed down
		jEdit startup, since many plugins performed a lot of lengthy
		initialization.
		Even if all plugins made their <tt class="function">start()</tt>
		methods as quick as possible, there would still be the overhead of
		scanning the JAR files, loading the plugin classes, and so on.</p></li><li><p>There was no way to reload plugins in a running jEdit
		instance. This made plugin development and use of the plugin manager
		a bit cumbersome.</p></li></ul></div><p>
		Through a stroke of insight, one notices that the only
		functions called from most plugins' <tt class="function">start()</tt>
		methods fall into two categories:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Registration of virtual file systems, fold handlers,
		macro handlers, Console shells, SideKick parsers, ...</p></li><li><p>Arbitriary initialization that only needs to be
		done when the plugin is first invoked by the user, and not at
		program startup.</p></li></ul></div><p>
		jEdit 4.2 moves the former task out of the <tt class="function">start()</tt>
		method and into a file within the JAR that can be parsed quickly. This
		allows the plugin core class to only be loaded, and its
		<tt class="function">start()</tt> method called, only when
		the plugin is first invoked. Note that the <tt class="function">start()</tt>
		method is always called from the event dispatch thread (or from
		the main thread if the GUI has not yet been loaded). Therefore you
		do not need to worry about thread-safety issues.
	</p><p>
		Also, plugins can now be loaded and unloaded at runtime.
